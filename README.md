# House_Classification
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to classify houses as "affordable" or "expensive" based on various features including area, number of rooms, location, and more. The project explores different encoding techniques for categorical variables and evaluates model performance to identify the optimal approach.

Dataset: Information about houses for sale, including price, area, rooms, geographical coordinates, and zip code areas in the Netherlands.

Key Steps:

1. Data Preparation: Initial exploration and preprocessing of the dataset.
2. Encoding Techniques: Application of one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, and target encoding to categorical variables.
3. Model Training and Evaluation: Training of Decision Tree Classifiers with each encoding strategy, followed by performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.
4. Comparison and Conclusion: Comparative analysis of encoding strategies to determine the best model based on performance metrics.
5. Deliverable: A concise report detailing the methodology, findings, model comparison, and recommendations for future projects.

This project aims to provide insights into effective strategies for housing price classification, contributing to better predictive modeling in real estate analytics.
